    summary: |
      I consider myself a respectful, organized person, with a high level of responsibility and very reliable.
      Mother of a 4-year-old girl, which has given me a lot of maturity and opened my mind to new personal
      and professional goals. In my opinion, motherhood has been a wonderful time to reconnect with myself, 
      listen to myself, search for my essence, question what success is?, and if success is only about growing
      the company. After motherhood I have a more human look to carry out my work in the company with more 
     dreams, more goals, more hope and more motivation; I see it as something that makes my life and what 
     I do have more meaning.
     I am interested in the gaming industry and business intelligence, thanks to my previous experience
    in Heritage sportsbook in customer service I have acquired people skills to be able to attend to
    my current clients who are my colleagues from various departments and those who collaborated to receive
    efficient work, solve their doubts and problems. I also have knowledge in networking , Db structure
    and agile methodology. In addition to this I am very enthusiastic, spiritual and eager to learn.
